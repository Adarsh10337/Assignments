Explain the concept of the margin in SVM and its impact on model performance.
Answer: The margin in SVM is the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points (support vectors). A larger margin indicates a more robust and generalized model, as it provides a larger separation between classes and reduces the risk of misclassification.
How do you handle unbalanced datasets in SVM?
Answer: Unbalanced datasets can be addressed in SVM by using techniques such as class weighting, adjusting the cost parameter, or using sampling methods like undersampling or oversampling to balance the class distribution.
What is the difference between linear SVM and non-linear SVM?
Answer: Linear SVM uses a linear decision boundary to separate classes, while non-linear SVM uses kernel functions to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, allowing for nonlinear decision boundaries.
What is the role of C-parameter in SVM and how does it affect the decision boundary?
Answer: The C-parameter in SVM controls the trade-off between achieving a larger margin and minimizing the training error. A smaller C-value allows for a wider margin but may lead to more misclassifications, while a larger C-value enforces a narrower margin with fewer misclassifications.
Explain the concept of slack variables in SVM.
Answer: Slack variables are introduced in soft margin SVM to allow for some misclassifications in the training data. They measure the degree of misclassification and help relax the strict constraints of the hard margin SVM, allowing for a more flexible decision boundary.
What is the difference between hard margin and soft margin in SVM?
Answer: Hard margin SVM aims to find a decision boundary that perfectly separates the classes with no misclassifications. Soft margin SVM allows for some misclassifications by introducing slack variables, which relaxes the constraints and allows for a more flexible decision boundary.
