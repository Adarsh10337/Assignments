    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the program typically stops running and an error message is displayed, indicating the type of exception that was encountered and where it occurred in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for many reasons, such as invalid input data, programming errors, or problems with system resources. Examples of common exceptions in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError: Occurs when the syntax of the code is invalid.\n",
    "NameError: Occurs when a variable or function is used before it has been defined.\n",
    "TypeError: Occurs when an operation or function is applied to the wrong type of object.\n",
    "ValueError: Occurs when an operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but an invalid value.\n",
    "IOError: Occurs when an input/output operation fails, such as when a file cannot be opened.\n",

    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error in Python is that a syntax error is a type of error that occurs during the parsing of code, while an exception is a type of error that occurs during the execution of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter encounters code that is not syntactically valid. This can happen when the code contains misspelled keywords or variable names, mismatched parentheses or quotes, or other errors that prevent the code from being parsed correctly. Examples of syntax errors include:\n",

    "When a syntax error occurs, the Python interpreter will display an error message that indicates the line number and location of the error in the code. The program will not execute until the syntax error is fixed.\n",

    "An exception, on the other hand, occurs during the execution of code when an error or unexpected condition arises that cannot be handled by the normal flow of the program. Exceptions can occur for many reasons, such as invalid user input, unexpected data, or problems with system resources. Examples of exceptions include:\n",

This traceback can be useful for debugging, as it can help you identify where the problem occurred and what caused it.\n",
