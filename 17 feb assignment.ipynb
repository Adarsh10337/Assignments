    "MongoDB is a popular non-relational document-oriented database system that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. MongoDB uses a flexible document model, which allows it to easily handle semi-structured and unstructured data, making it a popular choice for big data, real-time analytics, content management, and mobile applications.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular relations found in SQL databases. Instead, they use various data models to organize and store data, including key-value, document-oriented, column-family, and graph databases. Non-relational databases are designed to be scalable, flexible, and high-performance, and are often used for handling big data, real-time analytics, and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data, making it a popular choice for big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is optimized for high performance and low latency, making it ideal for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Schema: MongoDB's flexible document model allows it to easily handle semi-structured and unstructured data, making it a popular choice for content management and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, making it easy to add more capacity as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-Native: MongoDB is cloud-native, which means it is designed to work seamlessly with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP."

    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database system that offers many features that differentiate it from traditional relational databases. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which are more flexible than traditional SQL databases. Each document can have a unique structure, and data can be nested within documents. This makes MongoDB ideal for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemaless: Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema. This means that new fields can be added to documents at any time, without the need for schema migrations or downtime. This makes it easy to iterate on data models and adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is designed to be highly performant, with features such as in-memory caching and a built-in aggregation framework. MongoDB also supports sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Querying: MongoDB supports rich query language, including support for range queries, regular expressions, and geospatial queries. MongoDB also provides a flexible aggregation framework that allows for complex data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replication and automatic failover, which ensures that data remains available even in the event of hardware failure or network partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: MongoDB provides several security features, including role-based access control, encryption of data at rest, and auditing of database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-Native: MongoDB is designed to work seamlessly with cloud platforms, with features such as automatic scaling and integration with cloud-based services like AWS, Azure, and GCP."
