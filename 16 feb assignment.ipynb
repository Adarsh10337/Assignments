    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data. It is a vital component of modern software applications, providing a way to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases. SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency and ability to handle complex transactions, making them a popular choice for traditional enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases are often based on non-relational data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph-based models. NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle dynamic and rapidly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, while NoSQL databases can be based on a variety of data models.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more scalable than SQL databases, especially when it comes to handling large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "Data consistency: SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, which means that data is always in a valid state. NoSQL databases may sacrifice some consistency for scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "Transactions: SQL databases are designed to handle complex transactions, while NoSQL databases may not support transactions or may have limited transactional capabilities.\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use the SQL query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages or APIs depending on the specific database type."

    "n relational database systems, a primary key and foreign key are used to establish a relationship between two tables. Here is an explanation of each:\n",

    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or combination of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It is a way of ensuring that each row in the table can be identified and accessed efficiently. Primary keys are used as a reference point for other tables in the database, specifically when establishing relationships between tables.\n",

    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or combination of columns in a database table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing information to be accessed across tables in a database. The foreign key is a way of ensuring that data remains consistent across tables, especially when there are multiple tables in the database.\n",
    "For example, in an \"orders\" table, there might be a foreign key that references the customer ID number in the \"customers\" table. This foreign key ensures that each order is associated with a specific customer, and that the data remains consistent across both tables."
